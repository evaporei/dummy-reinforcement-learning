# dummy-reinforcement-learning

A very stupid example of a Reinforcement Learning (ish) algorithm.

It actually just takes the core principles and shows a simple program that keeps trying to get to the number 100, by giving rewards to it based on its actions.

I don't know math enough **yet** to actually do **real** reinforcement learning, so I did this very dummy simple example just to materialize something I learned on a Reinforcement Learning course I went to.
